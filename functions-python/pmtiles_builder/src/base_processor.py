class BaseProcessor:
    """
    Minimal base class for processors that read a GTFS CSV and write derived outputs.

    Responsibilities
    - Resolve the absolute path of the input file via the shared CsvCache.
    - Detect file encoding and initialize a fast CSV parser.
    - Provide a safe early-return when the input file is absent (some GTFS files are optional).
    - Delegate the actual line-by-line work to subclasses via `process_file()`.

    Lifecycle contract
    - Subclasses should override `process_file(self)` â€” do not call it directly.

    Notes on flags
    - `no_download` and `no_delete` are orchestration hints used by the caller (e.g., the builder) to
      decide whether to download the source file and whether to delete it afterward. The base class does
      not use these flags directly; they are honored by the orchestrator.

Here's a more polished version of the description:

# Update Validation Report

This function initiates the process of updating the validation report for all the latest datasets that do not yet have a report generated with the current version.

## Function Parameters

To support flexibility in handling different snapshots and validator versions, the following parameters can be used to customize the function's behavior:

- `validator_endpoint`: Specifies the endpoint of the validator to be used for the validation process.
- `force_update`: Forces an update by ignoring existing validation reports of the same version, treating them as if they do not exist.
- `env`: Specifies the environment (`stagging` or `prod`), used to determine the appropriate bucket name and project id for retrieving validation reports and executing the `gtfs_validator_execution` workflow.

## Function Workflow
1. **HTTP Request Trigger**: The function is initiated via an HTTP request.
2. **Retrieve Latest Datasets**: Retrieves the latest datasets from the database that do not have the latest version of the validation report.
3. **Validate Accessibility of Datasets**: Checks the availability of the latest datasets to ensure that the data is accessible for validation report processing.
4. **Trigger Validation Report Processing**: If the latest dataset lacks the current validation report, this action initiates the `gtfs_validator_execution` workflow.
5. **Return Response**: Outputs a response indicating the status of the validation report update. The response format is as follows:
```json
{
  "message": "Validation report update needed for X datasets and triggered for Y datasets",
  "dataset_workflow_triggered": ["dataset_id1", "dataset_id2", ...],
  "datasets_not_updated": ["dataset_id3", "dataset_id4", ...]
  "ignored_datasets": ["dataset_id5", "dataset_id6", ...]
}
```
The response message provides information on the number of datasets that require a validation report update and the number of datasets for which the update has been triggered. It also lists the datasets that were not updated and those that were ignored due to unavailability of the data.

## Function Configuration
The function relies on several environmental variables:
- `FEEDS_DATABASE_URL`: URL used to connect to the database that holds GTFS datasets and related data.
- `ENV`: Specifies the environment (`dev`, `qa`, or `prod`), used to determine the appropriate bucket name and project id for retrieving validation reports and executing the `gtfs_validator_execution` workflow.
- `BATCH_SIZE`: Number of datasets processed in each batch to prevent rate limiting by the web validator.
- `SLEEP_TIME`: Time in seconds to wait between batches to prevent rate limiting by the web validator.
- `WEB_VALIDATOR_URL`: URL for the web validator that checks for the latest validation report version.
- `LOCATION`: Location of the GCP workflow execution.
## Local Development
Follow standard practices for local development of GCP serverless functions. Refer to the main [README.md](../README.md) for general setup instructions for the development environment.
